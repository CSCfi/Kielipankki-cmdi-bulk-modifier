# Enhance Metadata in a CMDI Repository

Sometimes it happens that systematic changes, additions or other improvements
are needed to a possibly large number of records in a metadata repository. This
repository aims to offer helper tools for this kind of mass operations on a
as-needed basis.

Currently supported operations:
- Add affiliation for matching persons (first and last name) without affiliations
- Change person elements with "FIN-CLARIN" as surname into organization elements (where possible)
- Change person elements with "The Language Bank of Finland" as surname into organization elements (where possible)
